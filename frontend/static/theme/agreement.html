                    jurisdiction to be
                    invalid, illegal or unenforceable and can be deleted without altering the essence of

              <li>lottery DRAW TERMS ("DRAW TERMS")<br><br>
                <ol>
                  <li>In addition to your agreement with the Terms, the following provisions apply with
                    respect to you
                    participating in our contest draws ("<b>Draw(s)</b>") and winning the prizes
                    ("<b>Prize(s)</b>").</li>
                  <li>We may amend these Draw Terms at any point in time without notice and the amendments
                    will take
                    effect once they have been displayed on the Platform. You acknowledge and agree that it
                    is your
                    responsibility to review these Draw Terms periodically to familiarize yourself with any
                    modifications. Your continued use of the Platform and/or entry into Draws following any
                    amendments
                    shall be construed as acceptance of those amendments.</li>
                  <li>Draws will be approved by the relevant authorities in the UAE and are in accordance with
                    the
                    guidelines (as such they may be amended from time to time). A valid permit number will
                    be issued for
                    each respective Draw. Where Draws are being run from any other jurisdiction outside the
                    UAE where we
                    operate from, lottery will obtain the necessary regulatory requirements and permits as
                    stipulated by
                    the law in such jurisdiction.</li>
                  <li>Only users with a valid Membership to the Platform that satisfies all the Terms are
                    eligible to
                    enter into our Draws.</li>
                  <li>The types of Draws vary on the Platform. Each product purchased on the lottery App and/or
                    each Advert
                    viewed on the lottery One App in accordance with these Terms is associated with a
                    specific type of
                    Draw whereby a user is awarded at least a single complimentary ticket ("<b>Ticket</b>")
                    to that specified
                    Draw after purchasing the product or viewing the Advert.</li>
                  <li>If you purchase a product on the lottery App, you will have the option to either:<ol>
                      <li>Contribute the purchased product to the lottery International Education
                        Initiative (<b>“IIEI”</b>). In this case, lottery will
                        double your Ticket entry into the specified Draw so that two Tickets under your
                        name will be
                        in the Draw or award you with a fixed amount of credit in your Wallet, depending
                        on
                        the offer attached to the campaign at the time of your purchase; or</li>
                      <li>opt NOT to contribute the purchased product to IIEI and instead, either wish to
                        collect
                        the purchased product or pay an additional fee to have the purchased product
                        delivered to a
                        UAE-based address of your choice by a delivery partner of our choice.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>To collect your product, you must visit our premises within fifteen (15) calendar days
                    from
                    purchasing the product and present your valid identification (such as your national
                    identification
                    card, passport, driver's license, etc.) as may be required in our sole discretion.
                    lottery may, at
                    its sole discretion, allow an individual who has been given a written, valid and
                    effective Power of
                    Attorney (POA) by you to collect the product, subject to them presenting the necessary
                    identification. lottery will evaluate any such reliance on a POA on a case-by-case basis
                    and cannot
                    guarantee that an individual with a POA from you will be allowed to collect the product
                    on your
                    behalf. Failure to collect the purchased product within this time frame will result in
                    such product
                    being contributed to IIEI.</li>
                  <li>lottery reserves the right, without prior notice, to consider any unutilized credit in
                    your Wallet waived by you after a reasonable amount of time.</li>
                  <li>Ticket numbers are computer generated and may not be sequential to the order in which
                    the products
                    they are associated with are purchased. You cannot choose Ticket numbers as they are
                    generated only
                    upon checkout and completion of purchase of the associated products, or otherwise when
                    you have
                    finished watching an entire Advert on lottery One.</li>
                  <li>Tickets awarded to you through your use of our Platform are neither refundable nor
                    transferable and
                    are owned solely and exclusively by you.</li>
                  <li>The length of each Draw varies and the date when the Prizes are awarded can occur on any
                    day of the
                    week for the Draws that have 'sold out' a minimum of 24 hours prior to the day of the
                    Draw. The Draw
                    shall occur in the presence of a government representative, unless the government
                    authority approves
                    otherwise, and as such the results of any Draw are not subject to negotiation,
                    interference,
                    challenge, or argument by a user. The Draw date will be subject to the government
                    representative's
                    availability.</li>
                  <li>The deadline to enter any Draw using your Ticket is prior to the sell-out of all
                    products specified
                    within the Draw, or prior to the closure of the Draw (which happens before the Draw
                    date); or, in
                    the case of a timed Draw, prior to the end of the timer displayed on the campaign box of
                    the
                    specific Draw. The period of the Draws can be extended at lottery's sole discretion, and
                    we will
                    notify you of any such extension.</li>
                  <li>Winners of the Draws are selected by the government representative and will be notified
                    on the day
                    the Draw occurs. The names of winners may also be announced in the local and regional
                    press as well
                    as on the Platform and our associated social (online) media profiles, unless you
                    specifically advise
                    us otherwise in writing prior to the Draw. Unless otherwise specified, the number of
                    winners per
                    Draw will always be one (1).</li>
                  <li>On the Draw day, an email will be sent to the registered email on the Platform detailing
                    the next
                    steps and how you can claim the Prize, which may include the following:<ol>
                      <li>In the event the winner is based in the United Arab Emirates, then he/she needs
                        to collect the Prize from our premises within sixty (60) calendar days and
                        present valid identification as may be required, in our sole discretion, in
                        order to collect the Prize. Failure to collect the Prize within this time period
                        WILL result in us transferring the Prize to the government authority after which
                        lottery will have no further responsibility with respect to the Prize. Post
                        transfer, the winner must liaise with the government authority whereupon he/she
                        will be subject to their terms and conditions.</li>
                      <li>In the event a winner does not reside in the United Arab Emirates, we will
                        either courier the Prize to the winner by air or land, or ship the Prize to the
                        winner’s country of residence (nearest seaport as selected by us in our sole
                        discretion) at the cost of the winner. We can also insure the shipment of the
                        Prize at the cost of the winner. Collection from the port and clearance through
                        the port and customs shall be the responsibility, and at the cost, of the
                        winner. Accordingly, all local taxes, custom duties, and any other form of
                        expense beyond shipping and delivery at the port will be paid by the winner.
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>Once a Prize is handed to/collected by the courier/handler for international delivery,
                    risk and
                    responsibility will transfer to the winner and we no longer hold claim nor
                    responsibility for any
                    damage/injury incurred in transit, or upon delivery.</li>
                  <li>By entering the Draw, all winners consent to the use of any and all content made by or
                    provided to
                    us. This includes but is not limited to the use of their name, photographs, videos, call
                    recordings
                    and other material created during the Draw, in the local and regional press, on the
                    Platform and on
                    any social (online) media profile associated with us. You may choose to withdraw your
                    consent at any
                    time, but this may affect your entrance into a Draw.</li>
                  <li>All Prizes displayed on our Platform will be awarded, as displayed, with only minor (if
                    any)
                    physical changes.</li>
                  <li>Where the registration or transfer of ownership of a Prize is necessary, such
                    registration or
                    transfer of ownership will be made against the name of the winner only, as it appears on
                    the winning
                    ticket. By entering the Draw of a Prize where registration or transfer of ownership is
                    necessary,
                    you agree that you meet the required government and regulatory criteria to receive such
                    registration
                    or transfer of ownership.</li>
                  <li>If any winner is subsequently found ineligible to participate in the Draw, we may at our
                    sole
                    discretion reclaim the Prize or dispose of the same in such a manner and to such person
                    as we deem
                    fit. All such decisions will be in line with applicable laws.</li>
                  <li>We will not be responsible for arranging any insurance, including travel insurance,
                    medical
                    insurance, transport, meals, or any other expenses of a personal nature incurred by the
                    winner in
                    the collection of the Prize, unless otherwise agreed by us in writing.</li>
                  <li>We will not be responsible for claims, damages, or expenses of any nature whatsoever for
                    any loss,
